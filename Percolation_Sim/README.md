## Percolation

- An attempt to create a code to simulate Percolation(vertical) model in a 'n X n' grid.
- It has been Implemented using the Weighted-Union-Find Algorithm.
- The Percolation model finds uses in real life in stuff like: to find fraction of the materials
  need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor ; in a porous landscape 
  with water on the surface, under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom.
