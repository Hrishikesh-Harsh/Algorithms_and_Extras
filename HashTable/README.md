## HashTable:
- Implements Hash Table through Hashing
- Uses 3 different ways:
  - Chaining Mechanism
  - Linear Probing Mechanism
  - Quadratic Probing Mechanism
- The Hashing Function used is f(x)= x (MOD) number of elements
- A good general “rule of thumb” is:
  The hash table should be an array with length about 1.3 times the maximum number of keys that will actually be in the table, and
  Size of hash table array should be a prime number.
